# Install

The following will help you get μTox installed on your computron/toaster/carrier pigon. The focus of this guide is to 
get you running ASAP. And mostly deals with precomplied binarys. If you're looking to contribute (you're the real MVP) 
you're probably looking for [Building](BUILD.md).

## Unix-like

Dependencies:

```dbus filter_audio freetype libvpx openal v4l xext xrender```

Compile:
```bash
make all
```

Now install:
```bash
sudo make install
```

If make/install really isn't your thing, you can try some precomplied binarys.

### Archlinux

If you're luck enough to use Arch Linux, someone has an AUR package just for you!

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/utox-git/

<a name="osx" />
## OS X

No one is currently providing binaries for OSX yet... Sorry Apple people...

[I guess I'll try to build it](docs/BUILD.md#OSX).

<a name="windows" />
## Windows

Installing on windows isn't really a thing yet... you can download the nightlies. They should just work.

<a name="android" />
## Android

μTox on android has been neglected too long, so we're not currently providing binaries.

# Meta
[Jenkins](https://jenkins.libtoxcore.so) offers automatically compiled binaries. All files below link to the last successful build. [See which changes are in which Jenkins build of uTox](https://jenkins.libtoxcore.so/job/Sync%20uTox/changes).
